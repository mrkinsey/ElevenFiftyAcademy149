Three backticks will create a code box

If you are typing in some info and you want to **BOLD** text, you would use asterisks before and after

**This is how you bold multiple words**

To _italicize_ use a single under score.

**_This is now BOLD and ITALIC_**

If we want to bring attention to a singel word and make it `code` you can use a single backtick around the word. (this is useful to bring in a command)

`Whatever you type`
